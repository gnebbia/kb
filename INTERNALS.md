# Return Codes #

Within many of the functions of kb, core functionality may return a return code, indicating its' status upon completion.
This section explains those return codes and their meaning. Note that this is in addition to any data that may be returned from those functions.

|-------|-------|
| Code | Description |
|-------|-------|
| -200 | The function was carried out successfully |
| -301 | The function found more than one match for the criteria |    ** SHOULD BE USING 300 HERRE **
| -302 | The function was attempted, but could find no artifacts with the search criteria (does not include by ID) | ** SHOULD BE USING 406 HERRE **
| -404 | The function errored |



Most of these return codes are presented to the API in the form of an HTTP response code.


# HTTP Response Codes #
